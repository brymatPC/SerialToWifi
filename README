# Serial to WIFI

This project is based on work done by ssanci in the repository https://github.com/salsanci/YRShell.  The primary goals:

1. Provide a mechanism for using YRShell with Platform.io
1. Provide another example of how YRShell can be used on a project
1. Provide a potentially useful project for providing TTL level UARTS over WIFI
